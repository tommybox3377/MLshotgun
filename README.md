This is to quickly implement most of the classifiers, scalers, and PCA available on SciKit-Learn through a Grid Search. This is designed to be used in exploratory analysis to get an idea for which classifier might be good one to start with, although it can be used just as well for final adjustments for a selected classifier with little overhead.


Set up is done through setting parmeters in GlobalVars.py and Shoot.py then setting input data in Main.py and running Main.py
Note: that the time complexity of most of these inputs are exponential. They are currently set for a guess at best time/output ratio, but much teaking will most likey be required.
